bikeReport
==========

A customized weather report for cyclists around the world.  Currently in progress.

Features:
	
- a fully fleshed-out weather report app based upon the DarkSky weather RESTful API, covering just about any spot on the globe

- due to a lack of mission-creep, advertising, and general drama, provides a better experience and UI than The Weather Network

- city selection from either a drop-down box, search option or IP trace

- graph indicating trends in cycling conditions' quality over the coming week

- specifically laid out with the needs of a cyclist--commuters especially--in mind.  

- metascore analysis of conditions at any particular time, and for the coming forecast days

- live webcam snapshots of the area in a carousel to show present road surface conditions (adjusts width to the number of cams)

- Rotating weather-vane 

- animated thermometer

- Google maps API used to serve a local ornamental map for each report's header

- link to a Google map of the user's area's bike-friendly routes

- warnings to use lights during dusk, dawn, foggy conditions, and nighttime

- built with WCAG best practices in mind.
